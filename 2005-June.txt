Message-ID: <200506071954.j57JsUOD016203@unicorn.berlios.de>

Bug #4210, was updated on 2005-Jun-07 11:54
Here is a current snapshot of the bug.

Project: Layout Manager Pack for NB
Category: None
Status: Open
Resolution: None
Bug Group: None
Priority: 5
Submitted by: kushal
Assigned to : none
Summary: FormLayout - GridX and GridY can't change

Details: NB 4.1
JVM: 1.5.0_01
OS: Win2k

When i create a formlayout and add components, all have a GridX and GridY that are the same.  I setup a 2x2 grid where Columns=p,p amd Rows=p,p.  Every GridX and GridY is set to 2, so all components sit on top of each other.

I cannot change the values of GridX nor GridY, either (if i try, the GUI immediately sets the value back to 2).

Comment:
Please, check with 3 columns. I've reproduced the bug only if I needed to change the value to become 1, but it worked OK if I needed to change the value to become 2, 3, etc.
